# RealEstatePage---Lucky---Vote
Incorporating python flask with HTML templates &amp; CSS styling 

Note: This program was meant to introduce python Flask and incorporate HTML and CSS and does not handle events like submission clicking on the button although it will verify the appropriate input needed whether that is text, email, numbers. The program provies some images with anchor tags to real webpages. 

# Password information is also being hashed within the program and the use of date and time

# The realtor page of myself was an idea I had since I was a realtor at the time I made it. It may not be the case in the future so be aware that the link may or may not work. 

# I created four different webpages one is a voter registration form, 2 are for the real estate bio and submission for imformation page, and the 4th is a lucky number which gives you a random number between 1 - 100.
